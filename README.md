# Azure VMSS Script

This Azure CLI script create a VMSS with 2 VMs and other related resources. 
It uses cloud-init.txt file while running the command "az vmss create" available in the setup-script.sh  
The cloud-init.txt will install and start the nginx server (a load balancer) and a few Python packages.  
```
az login
chmod +x setup-script.sh
./setup-script.sh
```
Note: Azure CLI has a very simple scale command:
# Update teh capacity to 4 VMs
az vmss scale -g [resource-group name] -n [vmssname] â€“new-capacity 4
